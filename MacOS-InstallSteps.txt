BEFORE:
MacOS command line tools:
do this to bring up install:
git --version 

1. Go to brew.sh
2. Execute the command

3. RUBY INSTALL

brew install rbenv ruby-build

# Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# Install Ruby
rbenv install 2.2.3
rbenv global 2.2.3

VERIFY:
ruby -v


4. RAILS INSTALL

gem install rails -v 4.2.3

Rails is installed, but we need RBENV to see it.
For that, we execute the REHASH command

rbenv rehash


5. VERIFY

rails -v

rails new test_app

cd test_app

rails server
